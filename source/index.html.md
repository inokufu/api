# Introduction

Welcome to the Inokufu API Cloud! This API documentation shows you how to access our API endpoints, which can get information about Learning Objects in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "x-api-key: SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER"
```

> Make sure to replace `SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER` with your own Developer API key.

Inokufu API Cloud uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register for a Developer API key by sending us an email at [contact@inokufu.com](mailto:contact@inokufu.com).

For Demo purpose, you can use this API key : 'SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER'. 

Free Developer API keys are available on request and let you make up to 250 requests per month.

For higher request quota we offer paid usage plan starting at 100 $/month. Feel free to get in touch at [contact@inokufu.com](mailto:contact@inokufu.com) we are fully dedicated to the success of our customers and partners. Together we can make the education better. üòä

Inokufu API Cloud expects for the API key to be included in API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`x-api-key: SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER`

<aside class="warning">
Replace <code>SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER</code> with your own Developer API key to make more requests.

## Bloom

```shell
curl "https://api.inokufu.com/v1/bloom"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "bloom": "discover",
    "description": "These LO are the first step to discover a job or a skill. You'll be able to talk about it, to know the basics. You'll have all the knowledge to decide wether it's for you or not.",
  },
  {
    "bloom": "understand",
    "description": "These LO help you better understand this job or skill, in details. You'll dive deeper in the theory. You'll be able to explain, estimate, At the end, you'll be a master of the theoretical aspects.",
  },
  {
    "bloom": "do",
    "description": "These LO help you put into practice what you have learned. You'll make, manipulate, simulate. You are applying what you learn.",
  },
  {
    "bloom": "curriculum",
    "description": "These LO train you to a specific job or skill at a professional level. From Discovery, Understanding to Doing, at the end you are a Pro.",
  }
]
```

This endpoint retrieves a list of the levels of learning objectives associated to a LO and currently supported. These levels are adapted from those of [Bloom's taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy). `discover` is used as a synonym of knowledge, `understand` for comprehension and `do` for application. Curriculum was added as a compound level for LO that include the three other levels (`discover`, `understand`, `do`) in a coherent way (e.g. University degree).  

Bloom | Learning objective 
--------- | ------- 
`discover` | First step to discover a job or a skill. Memorize knowledge.
`understand` | Understanding a job or skill, in details. Being able to explain, estimate.
`do` | Put into practice what has been learned. Make, manipulate, simulate.
`curriculum` | Complete training to a specific job or skill at a professional level.

### HTTP Request
