# Introduction

Welcome to the Inokufu API Cloud! This API documentation shows you how to access our API endpoints, which can get information about Learning Objects in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('YOU-SHALL-NOT-PASS')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('YOU-SHALL-NOT-PASS')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: YOU-SHALL-NOT-PASS"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('YOU-SHALL-NOT-PASS');
```

> Make sure to replace `YOU-SHALL-NOT-PASS` with your personal Developer API key.
